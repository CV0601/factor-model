# factor-model
This is an attempt to create a factor model environment, it will include the following:
1. Data Retrieval
2. Factor Creation
3. Factor Selection (Dimension Reduction)
4. Estimate Factor Loadings to Portfolio
5. Reporting (package not yet determined)
The structure is yet to be determined. As I start experimenting and incorporating the methods could change or data source/structure could change.
